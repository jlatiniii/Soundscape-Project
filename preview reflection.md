In my soundscape preview, I started out working on hospital sounds. 
This scene will come right after the character gets into the car accident and is now in a coma in the hospital.
I will eventually add an overlapping voice to the ECG and respirator sounds which will represent the character's inner voice that no one else can hear.
I utilized the fade in and fade out effects as well as amplifying sounds and creating an echo effect. 
This is only a very small part of the beginning, but I feel as though I have already made a lot of progress considering I've never done anything like this before. 
Next, I will focus on getting character's voices recorded so that the story starts to develop. 
This will include family members talking to the individual as well as doctors and nurses talking. 
I'm still struggling with how I will successfully show the passage of time since comas typically last awhile and I want my conclusion of the patient waking up to be a relief.
I also took a recording of someone playing the piano and thought it sounded cool, so maybe I can include this in my project as well. 
I was thinking this mysterious piano playing could be heard in the beginning before the car accident, and then again at the end. 
I may not include this at all but I'm now starting to pay closer attention to the sounds around me and think if I could use them for my project.
